1,Edge of the Edgewater,Glaciers.mp3,43.079411,-89.390342,"Start by looking out over Lake Mendota. This lake and all the lakes in the Yahara River watershed are remnants of a vast glacial history. They were a river valley. Then glaciers covered them in ice. Then they become a big lake called Glacial Lake Yahara. The hill that that Capitol sits on was an island of debris in Glacial Lake Yahara. Then it was all a big marsh. Then it was the home of native people. Early statehood records describe how a lizard mound ""had to be removed"" (I quoted that skeptically) to grade Wisconsin Avenue.","Begin your tour here, gaze at the water",grass.JPG
2,Wiskonsen Avenue?,Wikonsen.mp3,43.0792606,-89.390146,"Now, the street is a line of cement that slices right across the isthmus. You can thank one James Doty, a wealthy New Yorker for this street and its name. After spending years convincing President Andrew Jackson to separate the then Michigan territory into two parts, Doty lost the Wisconsin territorial governorship appointment to his rival, Henry Dodge. Seemingly out of spite, he decided the only way to make a name for himself was to own more land. So he bought the land that you are standing on and had it surveyed and platted in the hopes of making a grand city on the Isthmus. These piles of glacial debris created views that he deemed worthy of a capital city. He was able to lobby Congress to move the Capitol to his Isthmus City from Belmont, 65 miles south west. He then decided he got to name all the streets. <br></br> This street and MLK Boulevard used to both be called Wisconsin Avenue, but the southern half was changed first to Monona Avenue to reflect the lake and then MLK Boulevard to honor Dr. King. Doty named most of the rest of the streets after other presidents and politicians. The word Wisconsin is said to come from a Miami Indian word for the Wisconsin River that means ""River Running through a Red Place"". If I were to imagine though, perhaps Doty wanted to make sure a street of prominence held the name of the state he helped territorialize. He even tried to change the spelling from Wisconsin to Wiskonsen.<br></br> Today we are left with a 3/4 mile stretch. If you hustle, you can probably safely make it from the Edgewater to the Capitol in 9 minutes. But for this tour, I invite you to meander, observe and contemplate.  <br> </br>  If you're sitting down, stand up, otherwise, walk towards one of the raised beds of plants that have a big light pole in the middle. I made this tour in November, so most of the greenery has faded to brown. There are plants, so there must be soil right? Mulch too I guess? How did these plants get here between all this cement and brick? Did someone build around them?",Turn around and sit down in one of the chairs if you can,lake.JPG
3,Edgewater Landscaping,Landscaping.mp3,43.079046,-89.38988,"This end of the street is occupied by the Edgewater Hotel. Most of the plants you see were planted by a local firm of University of Wisconsin-Madison trained landscape architects called Saiki Designs. They designed everything around the actual building. Take a look at some of the plants. They're planted in clean lines, weed free thanks to all that mulch. They are neat and organized, but still with an air of 'natural' right? Many of the employees on their website list 'native plant specialist' in their bio. <br></br> Closest to the capitol, I see the stumps of feather reed grass, an ornamental grass favored in landscaping for it's low maintenance and long-lasting  color even in cold climates. Another plant I see is <em>Allium angulosom</em> or Mouse Garlic, a bulb native to Europe. This plant is described as a 'summer beauty' for it's tall globular purple flowers. If you look at records from surveys done in the 1800's before Doty's time, you'll see the Isthmus was an oak forest, with notable bur, white and black oaks. Common plants in oak woodlands are blueberry, lead plant, sedges, asters. ",Walk up the stairs to the line of plants that lead your eyes to the Capitol,plants.JPG
4,Turf Grass Expanse,Lawns.mp3,43.078885,-89.38932,"This grassy lawn on the left side of the street is owned by both the Wisconsin Avenue Parking Company and the National Guardian Life Insurance Company. And yet the lawn looks uniform in height and color. Maybe one person mows the whole thing? And fertilizes it? <br></br> This grass is probably one of the three most common types of lawn plants in Wisconsin: Kentucky Bluegrass, Perennial Ryegrass, or Fine Fescue. None of these grasses are native to Wisconsin but they are ubiquitous for their uniform, green aesthetic. Each species requires varying levels of fertilization, irrigation, and herbicide use to maintain its uniformity, but all of them require mowing to promote their rhizomatic growth cycles. When I did this tour, I saw a couple throwing a ball for their dog. This lawn is one of only a few in this area that are big enough for a medium to large size dog to be able to run without bothering anyone. <br></br> Walk up and over the hill and either stop or glance a the National Guardian Life Insurance Building Sign landscaping. There are some bricks maybe to prevent erosion, plenty of mulch, grasses, and flowers. In the summer, many of these were purple coneflowers, a native prairie plant.",Stand off the corner of the sidewalk and look up the hill at the lawn,lawn.JPG
5,Residential Gardens,Residential.mp3,43.078224,-89.388486,"The 400 block of Wisconsin is one of the few that is mostly residential. Between the buildings and the sidewalk are small patches of gardens and lawn. As you walk down this block, notice how some homes have mowed turf grass like that lawn across from the Edgewater. Some have ornamental hedges like common box, arbor vitae and japanese yew. These are often advertised as 'neighbor blockers' or 'green barriers' between a building and a road. Some have vibrant wildflowers like orange daylilies, pink japanese spirea. One yard has what look like fern and geraniums without any mulch, so species that likely weren't planted like creeping charlie and purslane are growing too. These spaces likely aren't managed by landscape architects. They may be managed by a landlord, a resident, or the local wildlife.",Meander down this block and look at what plants are in front of each building,ferns.JPG
6,Vines,Vines.mp3,43.077493,-89.387521,"The side of 321 Wisconsin in the summer is covered in vines that contrast quite beautifully with the brick facing. The unruly nature of the vines makes the building seem more anthropomorphic than the large columnal structures next door. The leaves turn red in the autumn and fall off, leaving behind stalks that blend into the brick.",Walk up to the WI Ave side of the building,vines.JPG
7,Urban Gardens,Gardens.mp3,43.077476,-89.387352,"On the South side of the 321 building you'll see a line of cylindrical cement planters. These come full of soil with the apartments but they are curated by the renters. Some are filled with flowers, some with tomatoes, cucumbers, onions. All of them have something growing. The landlord doesn't manage any part of the planters, so if a resident leaves them be, they'll start hosting plants brought from seeds carried by squirrels, birds and caterpillars.",Walk a bit down the pathway between 321 and the Heibling building,gardens.JPG
8,Memorial Garden,Memorials.mp3,43.076505,-89.386124,"This block is taken up entirely by the First United Methodist Church. Along the building you'll see those green barrier hedges, some shrubby trees. As you pass the mulched garden around the cement cross, notice the planted milkweed, which is the only food that the endangered monarch butterfly caterpillars eat. Then explore the two planted areas next to the parking lots. These are part of the memorial gardens, managed by church volunteers. There is a rock on one engraved with the garden name. Peonies are planted with signs in front of them telling you people they memorialize. On the further end, a wooden archway memorializes George and Naomi Vitenese. George was the first professional golfer in Wisconsin to play in the British Open at the age of 66 in 1970. He is the founder of Vitense Golfland and his family still operates it. <img id='stop-img' src='../img/hochunk.JPG'> Walk to the corner of the block and look for the large rock. It says Ho Chunk Ancestral Homeland. Take a moment to imagine what this particular spot may have looked like before colonization, when the land was an oak woodland. Right now, this land acknowledgement sits on a privately owned, tax-exempt piece of Christian Property on top of Kentucky bluegrass.",Walk across the lawn to the memorial archway and garden,memorial.JPG
9,Row Trees,Trees.mp3,43.076123,-89.386047,"Once you've safely reached the boulevard, turn around to face Lake Mendota again and look at the side of the street you just walked up. Instead of focusing on the lawns and plants, this time, look to the left of the sidewalk. <img id='stop-img' src="../img/rows.JPG"> You'll see mowed grass and a variety of trees. These areas between the sidewalk and the street are owned and managed by the City of Madison. They are sometimes called Rows and sometimes called Terraces. These terraces represent small areas serving multiple competing clients. The engineers need it for pipes below the ground that carry storm water runoff and electricty away and to homes. But the surface that you see is managed by the City's Urban Forestry department. On your walk so far, you've passed Hybrid elm, Norway maples, Skyline honeylocusts, Green ash, European Ash, Swamp white oaks, Linden, Hackberry and Ginkgo. This variety reflects the department's goal to have a 'diverse and resilient canopy'. Most of those species are non native. The base of the trees are often mulched or mowed. In some spots, you can see the roots of the trees rising through the soil. <br></br> Turn around and look at the trees on the boulevard. Gently touch the peeling bark if you are able. These are all Japanese tree lilacs. They turn a stunning white in the summer. On the ground you can see daylilies and grasses planted in neat rows. When I was there, a squirrel was feasting on an apple. <br></br> <img id='stop-img' src="../img/squirrel.JPG"> <br></br> Walk up the boulevard but before you cross back to the sidewalk, look that the cracks between the mulched area and the pavement holding the parking meters. When I was there, I saw dandelions squeezing through these tight spaces where just a bit of soil was exposed to the elements. Perhaps that has something to do with the squirrels.", "Cross Johnson and when it's safe, cross the street and stand on the boulevard",boulevard.JPG
10,Capitol Grounds,Capitol.mp3,43.075492,-89.384833,"You may notice that it's hard to access the lawn from the street. If you can, jump over either the black chain or over the cement stair cases to get onto the lawn. <img id='stop-img' src = "../img/park.JPG"> The Capitol park has gone through many changes. When the builiding was originally designed and built in the 1800's the park was heavily wooded and surrounded by a white picket fence. It was considered a rustic municipal recreation site for political rallies and ceremonial events. A new architect came in with the goal of 'formalizing' the park to match a newly constructed and elegant capitol building. He built a wrought iron fence and trimmed and cut down many trees. The <i> Wisconsin State Journal </i> at the time said it an improvement because "one now can see the Capitol and look across the Park under the trees". In the 1900's, following another building redesign, the city brought in landscape architect John Nolen to design the capitol park. He wanted to connect the flow of the city and the lake to the park and the capitol. Remember Saiki designs? They recently helped design plans for the Capitol Park Rehabilitaion Plan, where they say they tried to stay as sympathetic as possible to John Nolen's 1911 plan while still being able to integrate efficiency and security measures. One thing they did was completely renovate the park's irrigation system to restore the bluegrass lawn. <br></br> Walk across the bluegrass to the circular flower bed. This is called the Gold Star Memorial Garden and it honors Gold Star families of Wisconsin. The grounds team mostly plants pansies and coleus. The team, when interviewed in 2024, noted that they want to start including Wisconsin's state flower, the wood violet. <br></br> Now look up at the canopy. These trees, many that are 200 year old oaks, represent both those that lasted through the many trimmings and cuttings through the years, and those that were planted. The Capitol grounds is the park of the government. Kentucky bluegrass, Wisconsin's most common lawn grass, flowers as memorials, a theme on this street, and giant towering oaks are the plant life that represent our state. I hope you were able to connect to some of the plant inhabitants of this street and also learn something about how they got here.",Cross the street and walk up to the left side of the Capitol lawn,capitol.JPG
